# Cover-Crop-SDM
Kantar Lab Cover Crop Project Summer 2025
Current, 2050, 2070 climate data
Species Distribution Modelling, Suitability Maps, Overlays for 14 common cover crop species

Occurrence data were obtained from iNaturalist ( https://www.gbif.org/).
These occurrence points were used to query the datasets examined in this study which included the WorldClim 2.1 climate data (all 19 bioclim variables for temperature and precipitation).
Soil properties were downloaded from the global soil database ISRIC World Soil (https://www.isric.org – (Hengl et al., 2017).

Data was downloaded at the highest available spatial resolution of 30 seconds (∼1 km2).
