## Cover Crops in a Changing Climate: Spatial Modeling of Current and Future Suitability


Species Distribution Modelling, Suitability Maps, Overlays for 14 common cover crop species using current, 2050, and 2070, climate data.

Occurrence data were obtained from iNaturalist ( https://www.gbif.org/).

These occurrence points were used to query the datasets examined in this study which included the WorldClim 2.1 climate data (all 19 bioclim variables for temperature and precipitation).

Soil properties were downloaded from the global soil database ISRIC World Soil (https://www.isric.org – (Hengl et al., 2017).

Data was downloaded at the highest available spatial resolution of 30 seconds (∼1 km2).

R version lang/R/4.2.1-foss-2022a via HPC used.

Example given using Avena sativa var. sativa.
